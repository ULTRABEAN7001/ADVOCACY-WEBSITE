          Our group chose this topic because we're all aware that poverty is a
          major global issue. We want to combat poverty alongside our fellow
          Filipinos affected by it. Many problems, like rising crime rates and
          disease outbreaks, stem from poverty. Analyzing the interconnected
          nature of poverty and considering factors like sustaining solutions
          demonstrates a holistic problem-solving approach. By delving into the
          complexities of poverty, our group will use the values of service,
          prudence, and generosity to provide insights for more effective and
          sustainable solutions.
