    <span class="sect1 paragraph">
      <p>Our group has chosen this specific topic since we are all aware that poverty is one of the biggest issues that plagues the world. We chose this because we want to battle poverty along with our fellow Filipinos affected by it. Most issues are the result of poverty for example crime rates increasing and minor outbreaks of diseases. Analyzing the interconnected nature of poverty and considering other factors such as maintaining the solution to poverty and its repercussions demonstrates a holistic approach to problem-solving. By delving into the complexities surrounding poverty, our group will use the values of service, prudence, and generosity to contribute valuable insights that could pave the way for more effective and sustainable solutions.</p>
